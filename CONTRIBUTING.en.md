To make the AllinONE platform even better, we have planned the next phase of key development directions. If you are interested in any of the following areas, we warmly welcome you to get involved and contribute your wisdom and strength! These tasks are not only technical challenges but also require the joint efforts of product, design, and community operations.

### 1. Platform Security Reinforcement

Security is the lifeline of the platform. We need to build an environment where all users can trade and play with peace of mind.
-   **Login and Authentication Enhancement**: Add features like login captchas and two-factor authentication (2FA).
-   **Fund Security Protection**: Design and implement mechanisms such as transaction passwords, withdrawal reviews, and abnormal transaction monitoring.
-   **Anti-Cheat System**: Research and develop effective detection and prevention measures against in-game cheating and malicious score farming.
-   **Data Privacy and Encryption**: Ensure the absolute security of user data during transmission and storage.

### 2. Account System Optimization

We want to provide users with a richer and more personalized account management experience.
-   **Personalized Profile Pages**: Allow users to customize their profiles to display game achievements, item collections, and personal information.
-   **Refined Notification System**: Users can freely subscribe to or disable different types of notifications, such as transaction alerts, friend updates, and community announcements.
-   **Third-Party Account Linking**: Support linking with accounts like Steam, Google, WeChat, etc., for convenient login and social interaction.
-   **Privacy Settings**: Provide more flexible privacy options, allowing users to decide what information is visible to others.

### 3. Game Ecosystem and Feature Expansion

Gaming is the core of the platform. We will continuously enrich the gameplay and enhance the player experience.
-   **Introduce More Game Genres**: In addition to existing games, we plan to introduce more diverse genres like strategy, RPG, and sports.
-   **Enhance In-Game Social Features**: Build a more robust friend system, team/guild system, and built-in voice chat.
-   **Achievement and Honor System**: Design a platform-wide achievement system to give players more recognition for their efforts.
-   **Global Leaderboards**: Set up leaderboards for various games and economic indicators to stimulate player competition.
-   **Item Marketplace Optimization**: Improve search and filter functions, and introduce fairer bidding and escrow transaction models.

This is just a part of our future blueprint. If you have any other great ideas or find areas for improvement in existing features, please don't hesitate to let us know via [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) (please replace with your repository address)!
